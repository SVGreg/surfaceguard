// The built-in packs are embedded in the binary, so compiling them yields the
// same result every time within a process — yet every caller that did not hand
// its own rules to scan.New or guard.Guard paid for it again. Measured on the
// M5-08 benchmarks, that was ~108 ms and ~17 MB of allocations per cold
// decision, which is most of what a load-time gate costs before its cache warms
// (README, "Measured latency").

// Builtin returns the compiled embedded rule-packs. These are compiled into the
// binary (go:embed), so tampering with them is binary tampering; explicit
// signature verification of packs is a hardening item (design §8.2,
// PROGRESS.md).
//
// Compilation happens once per process. The returned *slice* is a fresh copy —
// callers append external --rulepack packs to it (cmd/surfaceguard.loadRuleset),
// and appending into a shared backing array would let one caller's rule set
// appear in another's. The *Pack values it points at are shared, and are
// **read-only**: nothing in the tree mutates a compiled rule after loading, and
// a caller that needs to must copy first. That is the whole bargain memoization
// makes, so it is stated rather than implied — see TestBuiltinIsMemoized and
// TestBuiltinCallersCannotDisturbEachOther.

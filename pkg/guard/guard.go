// Package guard answers one question — may this skill enter the model's
// context? — in a single call, for callers sitting in an agent loop or an
// install step.
//
// It is the entrypoint `docs/surfaceguard-design.md §11.1` specifies. Everything
// it does is already available from pkg/skill, pkg/scan and pkg/verify; what
// this package adds is the *decision*, so every caller does not re-derive one
// from a scan report and a verification result. The existing Claude Code hook
// is the cautionary example: it parses `verify`'s text output to work out what
// the binary already knew.
//
// Nothing here executes anything from the bundle, and nothing touches the
// network.

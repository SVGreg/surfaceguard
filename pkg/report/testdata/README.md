# `pkg/report` test fixtures

## `sarif-schema-2.1.0.json`

The official SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema, vendored so the emitter can be validated
**offline** — surfaceguard's determinism principle means the test suite must not
need the network, in CI or in an air-gapped review.

Refresh it by re-downloading from that URL and updating this table. Only
`sarif_schema_test.go` reads it; nothing in the binary does.

## `golden/`

Pinned emitter output. `golden/synthetic.sarif` is rendered from a **hand-built
report**, not from scanning a fixture, so it pins the wire format without
churning every time a rule pack changes. `golden/benign.sarif` is a real scan of
`testdata/benign`, which has no findings and is therefore stable too.

Regenerate after an intended format change:

```sh
go test ./pkg/report/ -run TestSARIFGolden -update
```

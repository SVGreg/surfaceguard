# SurfaceGuard

**Know what you're letting in.** Security, signing and provenance for everything
an agent loads.

An agent's attack surface is whatever you allow into its context. SurfaceGuard
scans, signs and verifies those artifacts — today [Agent
Skills](https://owasp.org/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/) (`SKILL.md`
bundles) against the **OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10**, with plugins, MCP servers
and other agent-facing sources on the roadmap. It catches prompt-injection,
jailbreak, data-exfiltration, unsafe-execution, secret and metadata risks
*before* the model sees them, and lets publishers cryptographically sign an
artifact so consumers can verify its integrity and provenance.

Use it as a **CLI** (`surfaceguard`) in CI or as a pre-load gate, or as a **Go
library** embedded in an agent loop.

> **Renamed from `skill-guard` in v0.4.0.** The scope outgrew "skills", and two
> unrelated projects already used the old name. Rule ids (`SG-*`), the SGMT-1
> Merkle format, `.skillsig` attestations and every emitted schema id are
> **unchanged** — existing signatures and SARIF logs stay valid. See
> [`docs/rename-migration.md`](docs/rename-migration.md).

> Status: five milestones are implemented and runnable — **scan** (rule packs,
> policy, risk score), **sign/verify** (SGMT-1 + DSSE), **SARIF/CI**,
> **OMS + Sigstore keyless interop**, and the **load-time / install-time gate**
> with verifiable skill cards. Next up is the taint-analysis engine. See
> [`docs/surfaceguard-design.md`](docs/surfaceguard-design.md) for the full design
> and [`docs/v1-dev-plan.md`](docs/v1-dev-plan.md) for what is tracked to v1.

## Install

### Prebuilt binary (no Go required)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SVGreg/surfaceguard/main/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your OS/architecture (macOS/Linux, amd64/arm64), verifies the release
checksum, and installs to `/usr/local/bin` (override with `INSTALL_DIR`; pin a release with
`VERSION=v0.3.0`). On Windows, download the `.zip` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/SVGreg/surfaceguard/releases) and put `surfaceguard.exe`
on your `PATH`.

### From source

Requires **Go 1.26+**.

```sh
# from a checkout
go build -o surfaceguard ./cmd/surfaceguard

# or install into $GOBIN
go install github.com/SVGreg/surfaceguard/cmd/surfaceguard@latest
```

Check it works:

```sh
surfaceguard version
```

```
surfaceguard 0.1.0-dev
  rulepack core-exec@1.0.0 (5 rules)
  rulepack core-injection@1.0.0 (5 rules)
  rulepack core-metadata@1.0.0 (2 rules)
  rulepack core-network@1.0.0 (4 rules)
  rulepack core-secret@1.0.0 (4 rules)
```

---

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Scan a skill for risks
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill

# 2. Create a signing key (keep the .key file secret)
surfaceguard keygen --out publisher.key

# 3. Sign the skill (writes ./my-skill/SKILL.md.skillsig)
surfaceguard sign ./my-skill --key publisher.key --identity oidc:you@example.com

# 4. Verify signature + integrity + trust
surfaceguard verify ./my-skill --policy .surfaceguard.yaml

# 5. Or ask for one decision — scan + verify + policy — before loading it
surfaceguard guard ./my-skill            # allow / warn / deny
```

A **skill path** is either a **bundle directory** containing a `SKILL.md`
(plus any scripts/config), or a **single `SKILL.md` file**.

---

## Commands

### `scan`

Scan a skill against the static ruleset and print findings.

```sh
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill
```

On a malicious skill:

```
verdict: fail   risk score: 100/100 (L3)   [crit 4, high 11, med 0, low 0, info 0]
  setup.sh:3   SG-NET-002  critical  Pipe-to-shell execution                    AST01
  setup.sh:6   SG-SEC-001  critical  Sensitive-path read                        AST03
  setup.sh:11  SG-NET-002  critical  Pipe-to-shell execution                    AST01

  setup.sh:15  SG-SSRF-001 high      Cloud metadata / SSRF endpoint access      AST03, AST01

OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 references:
  AST01  Malicious Skills        https://owasp.org/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/ast01.html
  AST03  Over-Privileged Skills  https://owasp.org/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/ast03.html
```

Each finding is mapped to the corresponding **OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10** risk
(`AST01`–`AST10`); the legend below the findings resolves each cited id to its
title and page. Run with `--verbose` to print the OWASP reference inline per
finding (alongside the rationale and suggested fix).

Line numbers point at the exact location in the file (front-matter and body
lines are reported as true `SKILL.md` line numbers).

On a clean skill:

```
verdict: pass   risk score: 0/100 (L0)   [crit 0, high 0, med 0, low 0, info 0]
  no findings
```

**Common options:**

```sh
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --verbose                 # show rationale + suggested fix per finding
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format json --out report.json
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format sarif --out results.sarif   # GitHub code scanning
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --policy .surfaceguard.yaml --fail-on critical
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --rulepack ./extra-rules.yaml   # add rules (repeatable)
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format` | `text` (default), `json`, `skill-card`, or `sarif` |
| `--out` | write output to a file instead of stdout |
| `--policy` | policy file with thresholds, waivers, allowlists, trust roster |
| `--fail-on` | override fail threshold: `critical \| high \| medium \| low` |
| `--rulepack` | extra rule-pack YAML to load (repeatable) |
| `-v, --verbose` | show rationale and suggested fix per finding |
| `--no-color` | disable ANSI color |

### `keygen`

Generate a signing key pair. Two files are written:

- `<name>.key` — the **private** key (mode `0600`); keep secret, never share or commit.
- `<name>.pub` — the **public** key (mode `0644`); safe to share, commit, or publish.

```sh
surfaceguard keygen --out publisher.key                 # ed25519 (default)
surfaceguard keygen --out oms.key --type ecdsa-p256     # OMS-compatible
```

**`--type`** picks the algorithm. `ed25519` is the default and is what
surfaceguard's own SGMT-1 attestations use. `ecdsa-p256` exists because
[OpenSSF Model Signing](docs/oms-notes.md) mandates EC P-256/384/521 for its
key and certificate signing methods and does not include Ed25519 — so a key
that must verify with OMS tooling has to be an EC key. Both types sign and
verify through the same commands; the algorithm is recorded in the key file,
the `.pub`, and the trust roster entry.

```
wrote publisher.key (mode 0600, private — keep secret)
  keyid: sg-8f7164b591be
  public_key: xllKlT5UIVX+Pw1QC+W2SDzM8mYCeebWrW+mOuA2/aM=
wrote publisher.pub (mode 0644, public — safe to share)
  share the public key so verifiers can add it to their policy trust roster.
```

The `.key` is self-contained — `sign` needs only it. The `.pub` is a
convenience for distribution; its `keyid`/`algorithm`/`public_key` fields drop
straight into a [trust roster](#publisher-identity--trust-sg-prv-005):

```json
{
  "keyid": "sg-8f7164b591be",
  "algorithm": "ed25519",
  "public_key": "xllKlT5UIVX+Pw1QC+W2SDzM8mYCeebWrW+mOuA2/aM="
}
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--out` | private key file path (default `surfaceguard.key`) |
| `--pub` | public key file path (default `<name>.pub`) |
| `--no-pub` | do not write the `.pub` file |
| `--keyid` | key identifier recorded in signatures (default derived from public key) |

> The `.key` is currently stored **unencrypted** (mode `0600`); protect it with
> filesystem permissions. At-rest encryption is planned — a cleartext `.pub`
> means you'll still be able to share the public half without decrypting the secret.

### `sign`

Compute the bundle's SGMT-1 **Merkle root** and write a detached
[DSSE](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse) attestation, signed with your
key, to `SKILL.md.skillsig` next to the skill. By default it also embeds the
result of a scan.

```sh
surfaceguard sign ./my-skill --key publisher.key --identity oidc:you@example.com
```

```
wrote my-skill/SKILL.md.skillsig
  merkle_root sha256:fecb86e0c1ed98a5a04f1b5a53d0ae10bd958d25d5e60e35ef43e9ede52a23af
  scan attached: pass
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--key` | key file from `keygen` — `ed25519` or `ecdsa-p256` (**required**) |
| `--identity` | publisher identity claim, e.g. `oidc:you@example.com` |
| `--no-scan` | integrity-only attestation (does not embed a scan result) |
| `--emit-manifest-fields` | also write USF `content_hash`/`signature` into `SKILL.md` front-matter |
| `--ttl-days` | attestation validity in days (default 365) |
| `--oms` | also write `skill.oms.sig` (OpenSSF Model Signing v1.0; needs an `ecdsa-p256` key) |

#### OMS interoperability

`--oms` additionally writes **`skill.oms.sig`**, an
[OpenSSF Model Signing](https://github.com/ossf/model-signing-spec) v1.0 bundle
covering the whole directory tree, so verifiers outside surfaceguard can check
the skill. It is written **alongside** `SKILL.md.skillsig`, never instead of it:
SGMT-1 remains surfaceguard's own format and its local trust model.

```sh
surfaceguard keygen --out oms.key --type ecdsa-p256
surfaceguard sign ./my-skill --key oms.key --oms
```

```
wrote my-skill/SKILL.md.skillsig
  merkle_root sha256:df97944f0c4772c981608e5a728cd5c4e469b83f3de97d5df29afac0f9bf0854
  scan attached: pass
  wrote my-skill/skill.oms.sig (OMS v1.0, 3 files, root ec1b7863800207778da088343c2b78e05d5e27fa…)
```

The bundle is a Sigstore bundle whose DSSE payload is an in-toto Statement v1
with the OMS predicate: every regular file with its SHA-256, the
canonicalization metadata a verifier needs to reproduce the file set, and a root
digest over the manifest. `.git`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.github` and
the signature files themselves are excluded, per the spec.

An Ed25519 key is refused here — the OMS algorithm registry mandates EC
P-256/384/521 — and the refusal happens before anything is written. See
[`docs/oms-notes.md`](docs/oms-notes.md) for the spec findings this implements.

### `verify`

Check a skill's signatures: that each is valid, that the content still matches
what was signed (no tampering or drift), and — with a trust roster — that the
signing key is trusted.

**Both signature formats are detected automatically.** `verify` reports each one
it finds, so you can see which trust path produced the verdict:

- `SKILL.md.skillsig` — surfaceguard's SGMT-1 attestation: Merkle root, publisher
  identity, expiry, and the scan verdict recorded at signing time.
- `skill.oms.sig` — the OMS bundle: per-file digests only. It carries no scan
  result and no expiry, which `verify` states rather than leaving you to assume.

```
attestation: present, signature VALID (trusted key)
merkle root: MATCH
publisher: "oidc:demo@example.com"
scan-at-signing: "pass" (risk 0/100)

OMS signature: present, signature VALID (trusted key)
manifest: MATCH
  SG-PRV-006  low  OMS signature carries no scan result
```

A failure in **either** format exits `2`. OMS manifest verification also flags
files present in the bundle that the signature does not cover — a payload added
after signing is caught even though every signed file still matches.

```sh
surfaceguard verify ./my-skill --policy .surfaceguard.yaml
```

```
attestation: present, signature VALID (trusted key)
merkle root: MATCH
publisher: oidc:you@example.com
scan-at-signing: pass (risk 0/100)
```

If the content changed after signing, the Merkle root no longer matches and
verification fails (exit `2`):

```
attestation: present, signature VALID (trusted key)
merkle root: MISMATCH
  SG-PRV-003  critical  Merkle root mismatch (tamper/drift)
```

Without a trust roster the signature cannot be cryptographically checked, so the
publisher is reported as **UNVERIFIED** (not "invalid") — add the publisher's
public key under `trust.keys` to establish trust.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--policy` | policy file providing the trust roster |
| `--no-color` | disable ANSI color |

---

### `guard`

Decide whether a skill may be loaded — `scan` and `verify` collapsed into the
answer a caller actually needs. An agent loop, a `PreToolUse` hook, or an
install wrapper acts on the outcome without re-deriving one from a report.

```sh
surfaceguard guard ./my-skill
```

```
deny  scan verdict: fail (critical findings, risk 100/100)
  scan: fail  risk 100/100 (L3)  [crit 13, high 46, med 6, low 0, info 0]
  signature: none
  SG-NET-007  critical  Rendered-image/link data exfiltration
  SG-INJ-002  critical  Hidden or obfuscated instructions
  … and 60 more — run `surfaceguard scan` for the full report
```

| Outcome | Meaning | Exit |
|---------|---------|------|
| `allow` | nothing policy gates on | `0` |
| `warn` | proceed, but a human should look — a warn verdict, or a missing attestation under a policy that only warns | `0` |
| `deny` | do not load — the scan verdict failed, or verification did | `1` |

**Provenance outranks the verdict.** A signature that does not match its
content, does not verify, or comes from a revoked key denies whatever the scan
found — reporting "verdict: pass" over a tamper finding would be actively
misleading.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format` | `text` (default) or `json` — the JSON carries every finding, the text truncates |
| `--mode` | `load` (default) or `install` — see below |
| `--policy` | policy file with thresholds and the trust roster |
| `--cache-dir` | cache decisions in this directory (`-` for the user cache dir) |
| `--no-scan` | decide on provenance alone |

**Caching** keys on the bundle's content hash, a digest of the policy, the gate
mode, and whether scanning was skipped — so one changed byte or one changed
setting is a miss, and a decision made without scanning is never served to a
caller who asked for one.

#### Measured latency

The roadmap's budget for a gate sitting in an agent loop is **single-digit
milliseconds on the cached path**. Measured, not asserted — `pkg/guard`, an
Intel i5-2415M @ 2.30 GHz (a deliberately slow machine; a modern laptop is
several times quicker):

```
go test ./pkg/guard/ -run XXX -bench BenchmarkGuard -benchtime 20x -benchmem

BenchmarkGuardCold-4                  164666196 ns/op     366036 B/op     1091 allocs/op
BenchmarkGuardCached-4                   513402 ns/op      61200 B/op      321 allocs/op
BenchmarkGuardCachedFile-4              1567840 ns/op     200990 B/op     1323 allocs/op
BenchmarkGuardNoScan-4                  1707937 ns/op      50830 B/op      330 allocs/op
BenchmarkGuardColdBenign-4             49951906 ns/op      62131 B/op      338 allocs/op
BenchmarkGuardColdPrebuiltRules-4     161987617 ns/op     358308 B/op     1082 allocs/op
```

| Path | Cost | |
|------|-----:|---|
| **Cached, in-process** (`WithVerdictCache`) | **0.51 ms** | ✅ inside budget |
| **Cached, on disk** (`--cache-dir`, what the hook uses) | **1.6 ms** | ✅ inside budget |
| Provenance only (`--no-scan`) | 1.7 ms | the floor: load, hash, verify |
| Uncached, typical bundle (`testdata/benign`) | 50 ms | ✅ well under a second |
| Uncached, 60-finding attack corpus (`testdata/malicious`) | 165 ms | |

**The budget is met**, with room: the repeated path a gate actually lives on is
under a millisecond in-process, and about a millisecond and a half through the
cross-process cache.

**One-time cost, and who pays it.** The built-in rule packs are embedded in the
binary and compile to the same thing every time, so they are compiled **once per
process** (`rules.Builtin()` is memoized; a later call is a 196 ns slice copy).
Before that, every uncached decision recompiled them: ~108 ms and ~17 MB of
allocations each, which is why the numbers above are roughly half what they were
and allocate 366 KB instead of 17.5 MB.

The distinction that matters when reading them: a **long-lived host** — an agent
loop, a server, anything calling `guard.Guard` more than once — pays the ~108 ms
on its first decision and never again. A **one-shot CLI run** (`surfaceguard scan
./skill` from a shell) still pays it, because the process exits. For a host that
wants even the first call cheap, pass `Options.Rules`/`Options.Contexts` from a
set you compiled at startup.

#### Install-time gating

`--mode install` is **stricter, never laxer**: it turns a provenance warning
into a denial and prints the capability surface the skill declares. At install
a human is present, the fix is cheap (fetch a signed copy, add the key), and
nothing is mid-session — whereas a hard block at load lands in the middle of an
agent's work on a skill the operator already accepted. **Whatever `load` denies,
`install` denies too**; there is a test asserting the modes never invert.

```sh
surfaceguard guard ./downloaded-skill --mode install
```

```
deny  no attestation present (install mode requires provenance)
  scan: pass  risk 0/100 (L0)  [crit 0, high 0, med 0, low 0, info 0]
  signature: none
  admits: tools [Bash(pdftotext:*), Read]
          reaches https://api.anthropic.com, https://example.com/pdf-guide
```

Wrapping an install is then a two-line shell function — nothing is copied into
place until the gate says so:

```sh
install_skill() {
  tmp=$(mktemp -d) && git clone --depth 1 "$1" "$tmp/skill" &&
  surfaceguard guard "$tmp/skill" --mode install --policy .surfaceguard.yaml &&
  cp -r "$tmp/skill" ~/.claude/skills/"$2"
}
```

The same decision is available as a Go call for embedding — `guard.Guard(path,
guard.Options{...})` returns the identical `Decision` the CLI prints.

#### Load-time gating in Claude Code

[`hooks/`](hooks/) ships a `PreToolUse` hook (pure Python stdlib, no install
step) that runs this gate every time the model invokes a skill: it resolves the
skill name to a local bundle, runs `guard --format json`, and reads the
`outcome`. A denied skill never reaches the model's context, and the reason
lands in the transcript:

```
surfaceguard blocked skill 'evil-skill': scan verdict: fail (critical findings, risk 100/100)
```

Three enforcement modes — `log` (audit only), `block-invalid` (block denials),
`enforce` (block warnings too) — plus a fail-open/closed switch for the hook's
own failures. Decisions are cached by content hash, so the repeated path costs
under a millisecond. Setup and the full mode table:
[`hooks/README.md`](hooks/README.md).

---

## Input & output formats

**Input** — every command takes a skill `<path>`:

- a **bundle directory** containing `SKILL.md` (plus scripts/config), or
- a **single `SKILL.md` file**.

**Output** (`scan --format`):

| Format | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `text` | human-readable findings (default) |
| `json` | machine-readable report for CI/tooling |
| `skill-card` | signed-summary card + attestation envelope (JSON) |
| `sarif` | SARIF 2.1.0 — GitHub code scanning, or any SARIF viewer |

```sh
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format json
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format sarif --out results.sarif
```

SARIF output is deterministic (no timestamps), and each result carries a stable
`partialFingerprints` entry computed from rule + file + matched text — **not**
the line number — so editing text above a finding does not close its alert and
open an identical one. Severity maps onto SARIF's three levels
(`critical`/`high` → `error`, `medium` → `warning`, `low`/`info` → `note`) with
the raw severity, confidence, and `ast` ids preserved in `properties`. The full
OWASP AST01–AST10 catalog is exported as a SARIF `taxonomies` component, and
every rule and result points into it — so the OWASP mapping survives the export
instead of degrading into an opaque rule id. Findings waived by policy are
emitted as SARIF `suppressions` carrying the waiver's stated reason, rather than
dropped — a waiver stays visible to review instead of silently shrinking the
report.

Each finding carries its OWASP `ast` ids, and the report includes an
`ast_references` map resolving every cited id to its title and page — so
tooling never has to hard-code the taxonomy. The full SARIF mapping — severity
levels, fingerprints, taxonomy, suppressions, and the CI gating contract — is
documented in [`docs/sarif-mapping.md`](docs/sarif-mapping.md).

### Skill cards can be checked against their subject

A skill card (`--format skill-card`) carries a `content_hash`: the bundle's
SGMT-1 Merkle root, the same value an attestation signs, recomputed whether or
not the skill is signed. That makes the card checkable — it names *which* bundle
it describes, so it cannot be detached from a clean skill and re-presented over a
modified one:

```sh
surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format skill-card --out card.json
surfaceguard verify ./my-skill --card card.json    # exit 0 match, 2 mismatch
```

A one-byte change anywhere in the bundle fails the check with `SG-PRV-007`. Note
what this is *not*: a card is unsigned JSON that anyone can write, so a match
says "this card is about this bundle", never "this card is trustworthy" — for
that, verify a signature. And the check is not a re-scan: a card's verdict came
from the policy in force when it was emitted, so re-deriving it under yours would
report a policy difference as tampering. Fields, versioning and the full
semantics are in
[`docs/skill-card-schema.md`](docs/skill-card-schema.md).

## Policy file (`.surfaceguard.yaml`)

A policy sets gating thresholds, waivers, allowlists, and the **trust roster**.
Pass it with `--policy`. Without one, the default gates fail on `high`+ findings.

```yaml
apiVersion: surfaceguard.svgreg.net/policy.v1

# Gating thresholds
fail_on: high        # critical | high | medium | low
warn_on: medium

# Require a valid attestation to pass verification
attestation:
  required: false
  warn_if_missing: true

# Temporarily suppress a rule for matching paths
waivers:
  - rule: SG-NET-001
    path: "scripts/*.sh"
    reason: "reviewed: talks to our own analytics host"

# Trust roster: public keys whose signatures are trusted on `verify`
trust:
  keys:
    - keyid: sg-8f7164b591be
      algorithm: ed25519          # or ecdsa-p256
      public_key: xllKlT5UIVX+Pw1QC+W2SDzM8mYCeebWrW+mOuA2/aM=   # from keygen
      identity: oidc:you@example.com

  # Optional: narrow which publisher identities are acceptable. Useful when
  # skills are signed in CI, where the key rotates but the identity does not.
  identities:
    - pattern: "repo:acme/*"          # `*` matches any run of characters, including `/`
    # - pattern: "repo:acme/*"        # scoped to one OIDC issuer (takes effect with keyless signing)
    #   issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

  # Key ids AND identities that are never trusted, whatever else matches.
  revoked: []
```

**Precedence**, in order: a signature must verify cryptographically; the key id
and its identity must not appear under `revoked`; and if `identities` is
present, the identity must match one of its patterns. With no `identities`
section, every roster key is admissible — the rules **narrow** an existing
roster rather than adding a gate every policy must opt into.

The identity checked is the one **you** bound to the key in your roster, never
the `publisher` field inside the attestation: anyone can write any identity into
a statement they signed with their own key. Certificate-bound identities from
keyless signing arrive with that milestone.

There is no built-in issuer or root of trust, and there will not be one — see
[Publisher identity & trust](#publisher-identity--trust-sg-prv-005).

#### Keyless (certificate-bound) signatures

An OMS bundle signed with a short-lived certificate carries its signer identity
in the certificate rather than in a key you registered in advance — which is how
CI signing works, where no long-lived key exists to distribute. `verify` checks
such a bundle against **roots you pin yourself**:

```yaml
trust:
  roots:
    - name: sigstore-public
      path: ./fulcio-roots.pem      # relative to this policy file
  identities:
    - pattern: "https://github.com/acme/*/.github/workflows/*.yml@refs/heads/main"
      issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
```

```
OMS signature: present, signature VALID (trusted key)
certificate identity: https://github.com/acme/tools/.github/workflows/sign.yml@refs/heads/main
certificate issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
signed at: 2026-05-14T09:31:02Z (transparency log)
transparency log: inclusion proof verified, checkpoint signed by a pinned log key
manifest: MATCH
```

Two properties worth knowing:

- **With no `trust.roots`, a keyless signature is reported as unverifiable, never
  as valid.** surfaceguard ships no CA and will not fall back to one.
- **Validity is anchored on the transparency-log timestamp, not on the clock.**
  Fulcio certificates live for minutes, so asking "is this certificate valid
  now?" would reject every keyless signature within the hour. A bundle with no
  log entry is refused rather than verified against the current time.
- **That timestamp is verified, not believed.** The RFC 6962 inclusion proof
  travelling in the bundle is recomputed, and the signed checkpoint must commit
  to the same tree — so a forged `integratedTime` cannot smuggle an expired
  certificate through its validity window. Pin the log's key to go further:

  ```yaml
  trust:
    log_keys:
      - name: rekor.sigstore.dev
        key_id: wNI9atQGlz+VWfO6LRygH4QUfY/8W4RFwiT5i5WRgB0=
        public_key: <base64 PKIX DER>
  ```

  Configuring `log_keys` makes checkpoint-signature verification **mandatory**:
  a bundle no configured log signed is not trusted. With none configured, the
  proof's arithmetic is still checked — that proves the entry is in *a* tree,
  just not whose.

Verification is offline and needs no Sigstore libraries: `go list -deps` on the
default build contains no Sigstore or protobuf packages, and the module still
has two direct dependencies.

#### Producing a keyless signature

Signing keylessly *does* need a Sigstore client, so it lives in a **separate Go
module**, [`keyless/`](keyless/), shipped as its own binary:

```sh
cd keyless && go build -o surfaceguard-keyless ./cmd/surfaceguard-keyless
surfaceguard-keyless sign ./my-skill
```

```
wrote "my-skill/skill.oms.sig" (keyless, Fulcio + Rekor)
  identity: https://github.com/acme/tools/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main
  issuer:   https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  logged:   2026-08-26T09:14:22Z
```

In CI, the reusable workflow needs no secrets at all — the job's OIDC token is
the credential:

```yaml
jobs:
  sign:
    uses: SVGreg/surfaceguard/.github/workflows/keyless-sign.yml@main
    with:
      path: ./my-skill
```

**Why a separate module:** the Sigstore client pulls in ~370 modules.
surfaceguard's core has **two** dependencies, and that is a property people
choose it for, so the graph stays out of it — `go install …/cmd/surfaceguard`
downloads two dependencies whether or not you ever sign keylessly. CI asserts
it: a job fails if the core module gains a direct dependency or if the
`surfaceguard` binary ever links Sigstore or protobuf code. Details in
[`keyless/README.md`](keyless/README.md).

**This is the only part of surfaceguard that needs network access.** Scanning and
verifying never do.

---

## Signature formats: SGMT-1 and OMS

surfaceguard writes two detached signatures over the same skill, answering
different questions:

| | `SKILL.md.skillsig` (SGMT-1) | `skill.oms.sig` (OMS v1.0) |
|---|---|---|
| Spec | surfaceguard's own | [OpenSSF Model Signing](https://github.com/ossf/model-signing-spec) |
| Attests a **scan verdict** | yes | no |
| Carries an expiry | yes | no |
| Verifiable by other tools | no | **yes** |
| Keyless signing | no | **yes** (Fulcio + Rekor) |

**SGMT-1 is legacy: fully supported, still the default, and not going away — but
new capability lands in OMS.** It attests something OMS deliberately does not
("this bundle was clean when I signed it"), which is why it stays. What it
cannot do is be checked by anyone else's tooling, and a signature only
surfaceguard can verify is a private note rather than provenance.

Emitting both costs one flag, and `verify` reports each with the trust path it
used:

```sh
surfaceguard sign ./my-skill --key oms.key --oms
```

Full comparison, the two trust models, and migration guidance:
[`docs/signature-formats.md`](docs/signature-formats.md).

---

## Publisher identity & trust (`SG-PRV-005`)

When `verify` reports:

```
attestation: present, signature UNVERIFIED (no trust roster — identity unverified)
  SG-PRV-005  medium  Publisher identity unverified
```

it means the signature is present but **cannot be checked**, because the
verifier has no public key to check it against.

### There is no global identity authority — trust is local

surfaceguard uses a **local, decentralized trust model**. It does **not** contact
any public key server, identity provider, or registry, and the `--identity` value
you pass to `sign` (e.g. `oidc:you@example.com`) is a **self-asserted label**
recorded in the attestation — it is *not* independently verified against OIDC,
Sigstore, or anything else. Anyone can sign a skill claiming any identity.

Trust is established by the **verifier** deciding to trust a specific public key
and binding it to an identity **in their own `.surfaceguard.yaml`**. The identity
shown after a successful `verify` is the one *the verifier wrote next to the key
in their roster* — not the publisher's self-claim. So "verified" means *"this was
signed by a key I have chosen to trust,"* nothing more (and, deliberately, not
"safe" — a valid signature only proves integrity + authorship, never safety).

### So: is adding the key to `trust.keys` enough?

**Yes.** Adding the publisher's key to the `trust` section of the policy the
verifier runs with is exactly — and the only — way to make the signature verify
and the identity resolve. `SG-PRV-005` disappears and `verify` reports
`signature VALID (trusted key)`. There is no additional registration step.

The catch is *whose* roster: **you (the publisher) cannot make your own skill
"verified" for someone else.** The consumer adds your key to *their* policy. Your
job is to make that easy and safe.

### Publisher workflow

```sh
# 1. Create a signing key ONCE and reuse it (a stable key = a stable identity).
#    Writes publisher.key (private, secret) and publisher.pub (public, shareable).
surfaceguard keygen --out publisher.key

# 2. Sign each release with the private key.
surfaceguard sign ./my-skill --key publisher.key --identity oidc:you@example.com
```

Then **publish `publisher.pub`** so consumers can trust it — commit it to your
repo, attach it to releases, or serve it over HTTPS; a signed git tag is even
better. It carries the `keyid`, `algorithm`, and `public_key` a consumer needs,
and it's safe to share because it holds no private material. Keep
`publisher.key` secret and stable; if you rotate it, consumers must update their
roster (and you should add the old `keyid` to `revoked`).

### Consumer workflow

Add the publisher's key to the trust roster in the policy you verify with:

```yaml
# .surfaceguard.yaml
trust:
  keys:
    - keyid: sg-8f7164b591be                                   # from the publisher
      algorithm: ed25519
      public_key: xllKlT5UIVX+Pw1QC+W2SDzM8mYCeebWrW+mOuA2/aM=  # from the publisher
      identity: oidc:you@example.com   # the identity YOU choose to bind to this key
  revoked: []
```

```sh
surfaceguard verify ./my-skill --policy .surfaceguard.yaml
# attestation: present, signature VALID (trusted key)
# merkle root: MATCH
# publisher: oidc:you@example.com
```

Verify the `public_key` you paste actually came from the publisher (compare it
out-of-band with what they published) — the roster *is* the trust decision.

### What `verify` reports, by roster state

| Situation | Report | Finding |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| No trust roster (no `--policy`, or empty `trust.keys`) | `signature UNVERIFIED` | `SG-PRV-005` medium |
| Publisher's key **in** roster, signature valid | `signature VALID (trusted key)` | none |
| Roster has keys, but **not** this publisher's | `signature INVALID` | `SG-PRV-002` critical |
| Key in roster but listed under `revoked` | `signature VALID but key REVOKED` | `SG-PRV-004` high — **exit 2** |
| Content changed after signing | `merkle root: MISMATCH` | `SG-PRV-003` critical |

> Practical takeaway for publishers: it isn't enough that *a* roster exists on
> the consumer side — **your specific key** must be in it. If a consumer trusts
> other publishers but not you, your skill reports the more severe `SG-PRV-002`,
> not `SG-PRV-005`.

### Beyond the roster: certificate-bound identity

Everything above describes the **local roster**, which is how SGMT-1 and
key-signed OMS bundles establish trust. An OMS bundle can instead carry a
short-lived certificate whose SAN holds the signer's OIDC identity — so identity
is checked against a CA and a transparency log rather than a hand-managed list.

That is implemented: see
[Keyless (certificate-bound) signatures](#keyless-certificate-bound-signatures).
It does **not** introduce a global authority — surfaceguard pins no CA and no
log, so the anchors are still ones you chose. What changes is that you pin an
*issuer* once instead of a key per publisher.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | ok — scan passed/warned, verify succeeded, or `guard` said **allow**/**warn** |
| `1` | scan **verdict: fail** (a finding met the fail threshold), or `guard` said **deny** |
| `2` | **verification failed** — invalid signature, tampered/drifted content, a **revoked** signing key, an attestation that is **expired** (or carries an expiry that cannot be read), or a skill card that does not describe the bundle (`verify --card`) |
| `3` | usage error (bad arguments, missing file, invalid flag value) |
| `4` | internal error |

`1` is a **finding**; `3` and `4` mean the invocation itself is broken. CI should
treat them differently — gate the build on `1`, but fail loudly on `3`/`4`
instead of reporting a clean scan. The bundled [GitHub Action](#github-action)
does exactly that, and [`docs/sarif-mapping.md`](docs/sarif-mapping.md) spells
out the gating contract.

---

## What it detects

Rules are grouped into built-in **rule packs** (data, not code — YAML), each
mapped to OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 IDs (`AST01`–`AST10`):

| Pack | Covers | Example rules |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `core-injection` | prompt injection, jailbreak, hidden/obfuscated instructions | `SG-INJ-001` imperative override, `SG-INJ-002` hidden/bidi/tag-smuggled text, `SG-INJ-006` system-prompt exfiltration, `SG-ANTI-001` anti-refusal framing |
| `core-network` | egress & remote-code fetch | `SG-NET-001` suspicious egress host, `SG-NET-002` pipe-to-shell, `SG-SSRF-001` cloud-metadata/SSRF |
| `core-exec` | unsafe execution | `SG-EXE-003` privilege escalation, `SG-EXE-004` persistence, `SG-ROGUE-001` rogue tool use |
| `core-secret` | secret theft & sensitive-path access | `SG-SEC-001` sensitive-path read, `SG-AS-001` agent-state tampering |
| `core-metadata` | manifest hygiene | `SG-MTA-003` over-broad `allowed-tools`, unsafe deserialization |
| `core-supply` | supply chain (AST02) | `SG-DEP-001` unpinned dependency, `SG-DEP-007` remote-package auto-execution, `SG-EVA-001` payload staged where scanners don't look |
| `context` | demotion, not detection | rules that **cap** a finding's severity instead of erasing it, so "matched, but lower risk than it looks" stays auditable ([design note](docs/design-note-demotion.md)) |

Findings carry a **severity**, **confidence** (with context modifiers that
down-weight code examples and documentation to reduce false positives), a
**rationale**, and a suggested **fix**. See
[`docs/rule-verification.md`](docs/rule-verification.md) for the detection
approach behind each rule, and
[`docs/owasp-ast-taxonomy.md`](docs/owasp-ast-taxonomy.md) for how each rule maps
to the OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (and why). Add your own with `--rulepack`.

## Use as a Go library

The CLI is a thin wrapper over reusable packages. For gating a skill inside an
agent loop, the one call you want is `guard.Guard` — it loads the bundle,
verifies whichever signatures it carries, scans it, applies the policy, and
returns a single decision:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/SVGreg/surfaceguard/pkg/guard"
	"github.com/SVGreg/surfaceguard/pkg/policy"
)

func main() {
	pol, err := policy.Load(".surfaceguard.yaml") // "" for the built-in defaults
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Cache by content hash: one changed byte is a miss, so a stale allow is
	// impossible. Reuse the cache across calls — that is what makes the
	// repeated path sub-millisecond.
	cache := guard.NewMemoryCache()

	d, err := guard.Guard("./my-skill", guard.Options{Policy: pol, Cache: cache})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	switch d.Outcome {
	case guard.Deny:
		fmt.Printf("blocked: %s (risk %d/100, %s)\n", d.Reason, d.RiskScore, d.ContentHash)
		for _, f := range d.Findings {
			fmt.Printf("  %s %s %s:%d %s\n", f.Severity, f.RuleID, f.File, f.StartLine, f.Title)
		}
		return // don't hand this skill to the model
	case guard.Warn:
		fmt.Printf("proceeding with a warning: %s\n", d.Reason)
	case guard.Allow:
		fmt.Println("skill is safe to load")
	}
}
```

`guard.ModeInstall` makes the same call stricter for an install step, and
`Options.Rules`/`Options.Contexts` let a long-lived host compile the rule packs
once at startup rather than on its first decision (see
[Measured latency](#measured-latency)).

<details>
<summary>Scanning directly, when you want the whole report rather than a decision</summary>

```go
bundle, err := skill.LoadBundle("./my-skill")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
packs, err := rules.Builtin()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// WithContexts carries the severity-capping context rules; without it a
// demotion rule silently does nothing.
report := scan.New(rules.AllRules(packs), policy.Default()).
	WithContexts(rules.AllContexts(packs)).
	Scan(bundle)

fmt.Println(report.Verdict, report.RiskScore, report.Card.ContentHash)
```

</details>

Key packages:

| Package | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `pkg/guard` | **the one-shot gate**: load + verify + scan + policy → one `Decision`, with a content-hash cache |
| `pkg/skill` | parse a `SKILL.md` bundle into an inert model (nothing is executed) |
| `pkg/rules` | rule-pack schema, matcher primitives, confidence math |
| `pkg/scan` | orchestrate rules → findings, verdict, risk score, skill-card |
| `pkg/policy` | `.surfaceguard.yaml` model, thresholds, waivers, trust roster |
| `pkg/attest` | SGMT-1 Merkle root, DSSE signing, Ed25519/ECDSA keys, OMS bundles |
| `pkg/verify` | verify attestation, Merkle integrity, trust, and skill cards |
| `pkg/report` | text / JSON / SARIF / skill-card formatters |

---

## Use in CI

Fail the build when a skill trips the fail threshold:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/surfaceguard.yml
name: surfaceguard
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with: { go-version: "1.26" }
      - run: go install github.com/SVGreg/surfaceguard/cmd/surfaceguard@latest
      - run: surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format json --out surfaceguard.json
      # exit 1 here fails the job when the verdict is "fail"
```

### GitHub Action

The repo ships a composite action that installs the released binary, scans, and
uploads the SARIF to the **Security** tab — findings land as code-scanning
alerts with their OWASP references attached:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/surfaceguard.yml
name: surfaceguard
on: [push, pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write     # required for the SARIF upload
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4      # the action scans the workspace
      - uses: SVGreg/surfaceguard@v0    # or @v0.3.0 to pin exactly
        with:
          path: ./my-skill
```

**Pinning.** `@v0` follows the newest `0.x` release; `@v0.3.0` pins exactly. Either
way the action installs **the surfaceguard release matching its own ref**, so a
pinned workflow keeps running the binary it was tested against — set
`version: latest` to opt out of that, or `version: preinstalled` to use a
`surfaceguard` you put on `PATH` yourself.

**On the marketplace** the action is listed as **Agent Skill Security Scan** — the listing name
has to be unique across GitHub and `surfaceguard` belongs to an unrelated project. The `uses:` line,
the binary, and everything else keep the name you already know.

**Runners.** `ubuntu-*` and `macos-*`. Windows runners must install surfaceguard
themselves and pass `version: preinstalled`; the action says so rather than
failing obscurely.

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | `.` | bundle directory or a single `SKILL.md` |
| `format` | `sarif` | `sarif`, `json`, `text`, `skill-card` |
| `output` | `surfaceguard.sarif` | file the scan output is written to |
| `policy` | – | path to a `.surfaceguard.yaml` |
| `fail-on` | – | override the fail threshold |
| `rulepack` | – | extra rule-pack YAML (one path per line) |
| `version` | *the action's own ref* | release to install, `latest`, or `preinstalled` |
| `category` | `surfaceguard:<path>` | code-scanning category — **set this per scan when a workflow scans several skills** |
| `upload-sarif` | `true` | upload to code scanning |
| `fail-on-verdict` | `true` | fail the job on a `fail` verdict |
| `token` | `${{ github.token }}` | only used to raise the API rate limit when resolving a release |

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `exit-code` | `0` pass/warn, `1` verdict fail |
| `verdict` | `pass`, `warn`, or `fail` — distinguishes the two outcomes that share exit `0` |
| `output-file` | path to the file the scan wrote |

**The upload happens before the gate**, so a failing scan still delivers its
findings — a build that only tells you it failed is not a review. A usage or
internal error (exit `3`/`4`) fails the step immediately instead of being
reported as a clean scan.

#### Scanning several skills

Each upload needs its own `category`, or every scan replaces the previous one's
alerts and only the last skill stays visible in the Security tab:

```yaml
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false          # report every skill, not just the first failure
      matrix:
        skill: [skills/pdf-tools, skills/db-helper, skills/deploy]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: SVGreg/surfaceguard@v0
        with:
          path: ${{ matrix.skill }}
          output: ${{ matrix.skill }}.sarif
          category: surfaceguard:${{ matrix.skill }}
```

The default `category` is derived from `path`, so the matrix above works even if
you drop the explicit line — it is spelled out because a hand-written second job
usually needs it.

To wire it up by hand instead, emit SARIF and call the uploader yourself:

```yaml
      - run: surfaceguard scan ./my-skill --format sarif --out surfaceguard.sarif
        continue-on-error: true
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with: { sarif_file: surfaceguard.sarif }
```

## Development

```sh
go build ./...        # build everything
go test ./...         # run the test suite
gofmt -l .            # formatting check
go vet ./...          # static checks

# end-to-end smoke test against the fixtures
go run ./cmd/surfaceguard scan testdata/malicious   # verdict: fail, exit 1
go run ./cmd/surfaceguard scan testdata/benign      # verdict: pass, exit 0

# the keyless signer is a separate module — build and test it in its own tree
cd keyless && go build ./... && go test ./...
```

The repository holds **two Go modules**: the core (`.`, two dependencies) and
[`keyless/`](keyless/) (the Sigstore signer, ~370). `go build ./...` at the root
never touches the second, which is the point — see
[`keyless/README.md`](keyless/README.md).

Fixtures live in [`testdata/`](testdata/): `benign/` (a clean skill) and
`malicious/` (an injection + exfiltration corpus — **do not run** its
`setup.sh`, it exists only as scanner test input).

See [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) for implementation status and
[`docs/v1-dev-plan.md`](docs/v1-dev-plan.md) for the tracked roadmap to v1
(OMS/Sigstore signing, load-time verification, taint analysis, LLM/dynamic
engines, language bindings, keyfile encryption).

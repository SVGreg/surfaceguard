# Fetch organization-authored Agent Skills into evaluation/orgs/.
#
# These are the vendor/org repositories surfaced by the skills.rest directory,
# plus the official collection behind skills.sh — professionally-authored skills
# (a security firm, a payments API, a database vendor, a deployment platform)
# that form a distinct, higher-signal slice of the corpus than the
# download/star-ranked registries. Because they are curated and widely installed,
# they double as a **regression anchor**: a finding here is a false positive
# until proven otherwise. Each is a public GitHub repo, so `git clone`
# is reproducible and the license is visible.
#
# For each repo we shallow-clone, find every SKILL.md, and copy its containing
# directory into evaluation/orgs/<org>__<repo>__<skill>/ exactly as it ships.
#
# Env:
#   ORG_REPOS   space-separated owner/repo list (default: the skills.rest set)
#   OUTDIR      output dir under evaluation/ (default: orgs)

"""Fetch Agent Skills indexed by SkillsMP (skillsmp.com) into evaluation/skillsmp/.

SkillsMP is a GitHub-indexer: its REST API returns, per skill, the GitHub
`owner/repo/branch` and the path to the skill's `SKILL.md`. We resolve each to
its bundle *directory* and download the whole directory (recursively) via the
authenticated GitHub contents API — `gh` avoids the raw.githubusercontent rate
limit that anonymous fetches hit.

Why this source: unlike ClawHub (download-ranked, its own registry) SkillsMP spans
many public GitHub repos and authors, which is exactly the author diversity a
false-positive corpus wants. Because it is star-ranked and dominated by a few
mega-repos, MAX_PER_REPO caps how many skills any single repo contributes so one
project can't skew the corpus.

Env:
  WANT          number of NEW skill bundles to save            (default 200)
  OUTDIR        output dir under evaluation/                   (default skillsmp)
  SKIP_DIRS     comma-separated corpus dirs whose skills to skip (dedup)
  MAX_PER_REPO  cap of skills taken from any one GitHub repo   (default 5)
  SORT          SkillsMP sort key                              (default recent)
                — `recent` spans many small repos (author diversity); `stars`
                collapses to ~5 mega-repos (affaan-m/ecc alone is ~894 skills).

Only bundles that actually contain a SKILL.md are kept. Requires `gh` on PATH and
authenticated (`gh auth status`).

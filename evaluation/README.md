# surfaceguard — Quality Evaluation Session

A reproducible security evaluation that runs `surfaceguard scan` against a corpus
of **real Agent Skills** and aggregates the results into a stats report.

## Corpus

Six sources, chosen for complementary coverage — a download-ranked registry, an
install-ranked registry, a GitHub index, org/vendor repos, Anthropic's examples,
and a security-research sample — so the false-positive picture reflects many
independent authors, not one house style.

| Folder | Source | Skills |
|--------|--------|------:|
| `clawhub/` | Top skills by download count from the [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) registry (500 distinct publishers) | 500 |
| `skillssh/` | Top skills by **install count** from the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) registry | ~200 |
| `skillsmp/` | GitHub-indexed skills from [SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com), `sort=recent` for author diversity, ≤5 per repo | ~200 |
| `orgs/` | Organization/vendor repos surfaced by [skills.rest](https://skills.rest) — `trailofbits`, `stripe`, `supabase`, `tinybird` — plus [`vercel-labs/agent-skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills), the official collection behind skills.sh | 120 |
| `aws/` | The AWS Agent Toolkit — every skill in [`aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws`](https://github.com/aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws) | 159 |
| `anthropic/` | Example skills from [`github.com/anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | 17 |
| `skillject/` | `data/skills_sample` from [SkillJect](https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/SkillJect), a malicious-skill research framework | 100 |

### About `aws/`

One vendor repo, ~160 bundles, written to a single house style: every skill ships
`references/*.md` under progressive disclosure, links AWS documentation heavily, and
describes cloud primitives — IMDS, IAM policy documents, `sudo` installs, `~/.aws`
credential paths, per-model prompt templates — that the ruleset also treats as risk
signals. That combination makes it the corpus's densest **false-positive proving
ground**, and it plays the same regression-anchor role as `orgs/` (a finding is an FP
until proven otherwise) at five times the size.

It is scanned as its own corpus dir so it can be read alone:

```sh
evaluation/scripts/fetch_aws.sh
CORPUS_DIRS=aws RAW_DIR=raw_aws evaluation/scripts/run_scans.sh 4
RAW_DIR=raw_aws REPORT_NAME=REPORT_aws.md STATS_NAME=stats_aws.json \
  REPORT_TITLE="surfaceguard — AWS Agent Toolkit corpus" \
  evaluation/scripts/aggregate.py
```

### About `skillject/`

SkillJect is an agent-security evaluation framework that injects shell payloads
into skill content and measures whether a coding agent executes them. The
`data/skills_sample` bundles it ships are the **carriers**, not the attacks: real,
community-authored skills (71 of the 100 carry an upstream `source_url` in their
`skill-report.json`) that the framework mutates *at run time*. The payload corpus
lives separately in `data/bash_scripts/` and is **not** vendored here.

So this folder behaves like the other four — an unlabeled real-world set, useful
for false positives — with the caveat that it is the exact carrier population a
published attack framework targets, which makes it worth re-scanning whenever
injection rules change. Each bundle also ships a registry-generated
`skill-report.json` (a third-party audit artifact absent from the other corpora);
it produced zero findings in the first run, so it does not skew the comparison.
One slug, `skill-finder`, collides by name with a `clawhub/` bundle.

Each skill can ship sub-skills that carry their own `SKILL.md`; every one is
discovered and scanned independently, so the scanned-bundle count runs a little
above the skill count. These are **real, unlabeled** skills: an excellent
false-positive corpus, but recall/true-positive coverage still relies on the
synthetic `testdata/malicious` fixtures. Registry/GitHub content overlaps across
sources — the fetchers dedup by slug, but a content-hash dedup is worth a pass
before quoting a headline finding rate.

### Two roles: pinned baseline and rolling sweep

A corpus is a **snapshot**, and the population it samples turns over continuously —
new publishers, new install rankings, new idioms. So the corpus does two different
jobs, and conflating them is how a scanner silently drifts out of calibration:

| Role | What it is | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Pinned baseline** | the vendored dirs above, fetched once with a commit pinned per bundle in `_manifest.json` | "did this rule change break anything that used to pass?" |
| **Rolling sweep** | a fresh slice fetched into quarantine each maintenance cycle by `sg-corpus-sweep`, scanned, mined, then deleted | "what do skills look like *now*, and where is the scanner wrong about them?" |

Sweep reports are **internal and git-ignored** — `reports/sweeps/<date>-<source>.md`,
alongside the raw scan output they summarise. They carry counts, rule ids and escaped
excerpts, never fetched bundle content, and they stay out of git because a sweep is a
point-in-time reading of other people's skills, not a project document. What gets
published is what the sweep files: issues describing patterns, and backlog rows. The
sweep tooling is
`sweep_diff.py` (per-bundle hit-rate movement between two `stats.json` files) and
`sweep_gaps.py` (bundles the scanner scored clean that still carry a risky primitive —
the counter-signal to false-positive auditing). `run_scans.sh` takes `CORPUS_ROOT`
so a sweep can be scanned from a quarantine directory outside the repo.

Sweeps do not re-measure the same slice: `corpus_ledger.py` remembers what was
fetched and skips it next time unless the rule packs moved, the source repo gained
commits, or the TTL lapsed — so successive sweeps walk down the ranking, and a
bundle that *is* refetched gets its `content_hash` compared against the last one,
which is how drift surfaces.

`skillssh/_manifest.json` records a `fetched_at` per bundle and every manifest pins a
source commit, so any set can be re-fetched and compared rather than trusted
indefinitely. Treat a corpus older than a few weeks as a regression baseline, not as
evidence about what skills look like today; re-run the fetcher before quoting a rate.

## Reports

| Report | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| [`reports/REPORT.md`](reports/REPORT.md) | combined — every corpus dir |
| [`reports/REPORT.html`](reports/REPORT.html) | the combined report as a self-contained interactive page |
| [`reports/REPORT_aws.md`](reports/REPORT_aws.md) | standalone — the AWS Agent Toolkit (159 bundles) |
| [`reports/REPORT_skillject.md`](reports/REPORT_skillject.md) | standalone — the SkillJect sample (100 bundles) |
| [`reports/REPORT_skillject.html`](reports/REPORT_skillject.html) | the SkillJect report as a self-contained interactive page |

Each report has a machine-readable sibling (`reports/stats.json`,
`reports/stats_skillject.json`). Each subfolder under a corpus dir is one skill
bundle (a `SKILL.md` plus its scripts/assets), exactly as it ships. Provenance for
every bundle is recorded in the `_manifest.json` in each corpus folder (ClawHub
owner handle + download count; Anthropic source commit).

> **Growing / consolidating a source.** Each fetcher writes only the entries it
> fetched into its own `_manifest.json`. To grow ClawHub without re-downloading,
> fetch into a temp `OUTDIR` with `SKIP_DIRS=clawhub`, then move the new bundles
> into `clawhub/` and take the **union** of the two manifests — that is how the
> 200→500 expansion was consolidated into the single `clawhub/` folder.
> `fetch_skillsmp.py` dedups via `SKIP_DIRS` and caps `MAX_PER_REPO`;
> `fetch_orgs.sh` slugs each bundle by its repo-relative path so same-named skill
> folders across a repo don't collide.

## Notes

- The scan uses only the built-in rulepacks — no custom policy or waivers — so the
  numbers reflect surfaceguard's out-of-the-box behavior.
- Static analysis flags **capability and pattern**, not confirmed intent. A `pass`
  is not a safety guarantee and a `fail` is an invitation to review — see the
  "Methodology & caveats" section of the report.
- Results are a **snapshot**: registry rankings and skill contents change over time.
